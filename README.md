Pizza Sales Data Analysis Using SQL :  This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to uncover trends data using MySQL Workbench. Its features include joins across tables and aggregation operations to summarize sales and track customer order behavior effectively. This project demonstrates practical SQL applications in a real-world scenario.

Description:

This project analyzes pizza sales data by performing SQL operations to gain insights into customer orders, pizza types, and overall sales performance. The project demonstrates SQL skills in data exploration, manipulation, and aggregation using MySQL Workbench. Queries were executed to extract meaningful insights from various datasets provided in CSV format, focusing on order trends, popular pizza types, and sales performance.

Files in the Repository:

1. pizza_sales_sql_operations.sql: This SQL file contains all queries used to analyze the pizza sales data, including data manipulation, aggregation, and filtering.
2. order_details.csv: This file includes details of each pizza order, like quantity, size, and specifics of each pizza ordered.
3. orders.csv: This file contains information on orders placed by customers, including order time and order ID.
4. pizza_types.csv: This file lists different pizza types, including ingredients, that can be used to analyze popular combinations.
5. pizzas.csv: This file provides a catalog of pizzas available, categorized by type and size.
   
   
Project Objectives:

1. Data Import and Setup: Import CSV data into MySQL Workbench and perform necessary transformations to create a structured database.
2. Sales Analysis: Execute queries to analyze pizza sales, determine popular pizza types, and track the sales performance of different pizza sizes.
3. Order Trends: Explore order times, frequency of orders by pizza type, and overall demand patterns.


Key SQL Operations:

1. Data Cleaning: Basic cleaning operations like handling null values and ensuring data integrity during import.
2. Aggregation and Grouping: Used to summarize sales data, such as total sales per pizza type and size.
3. Filtering: Filtered data to focus on specific pizza types, order times, and other criteria.
4. Joins: Combined data from multiple tables (e.g., orders, order_details, pizzas) to create consolidated insights.
Usage
5. Run Queries: Use pizza_sales_sql_operations.sql to perform SQL queries for analysis.
6. Import Data: Load each CSV file into MySQL as a table using the “Import” option in MySQL Workbench.
7. Execute Analysis: Execute individual queries to get insights on pizza sales, customer preferences, and sales trends.


Results and Insights:

1. Top-Selling Pizzas: Identified popular pizza types and sizes based on order volume.
2. Sales Patterns: Observed peak sales times and trends in customer ordering habits.
